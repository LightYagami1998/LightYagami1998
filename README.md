I’m RAHUL MURALI
- I’m an Computer Science Engineer by graduation. After the end of college I decided not to look for coding jobs(Just because in a country like India Software Engineers are Severly Underpaid) and started to look for alternate carrier options. In 2022 november I saw a ray of hope in the form of OpenAI. Now,It's not about getting a dream job in those so called "FAANG" companies with a decade of experience. It's about building that ideal SILICON VALLEY environement all over the world.Plus Developers don't get stuck in tutorial hell and writers block :). 
- 🌱 The Banks have given us 25% interest rate in credit cards.They have scrued us over Student Loans that we can never get out from under their debt trap.The long-term goal is to put a full stop to those greedy Banks through asset tokenization and blockchain.
- 💞️ I’m Currently looking forward to work for companies with similar interest for learning and growing together.
